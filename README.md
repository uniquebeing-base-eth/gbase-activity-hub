# Welcome to gBase 


Tap. Send. Active.

gBase is a simple Base-native app that helps users stay visibly active onchain by sending real transactions and tracking honest wallet activity over time.

No automation.
No gimmicks.
Just real Base usage.



# Overview

gBase allows users to manually send a small gBase transaction and record that activity in a clean, verifiable way.

Each transaction is:
	•	User initiated
	•	User confirmed
	•	Paid for by the user
	•	Recorded transparently

The result is a wallet that stays active and a clear activity record that can be shared on Farcaster.


# Why gBase

Onchain activity matters.

Protocols, ecosystems, and communities value wallets that show real usage over time. gBase makes it easy to build that history intentionally, without speculation or promises.

gBase does not guarantee:
	•	Airdrops
	•	Rewards
	•	Financial returns

It helps users stay present and verifiable on Base.


# How It Works
	1.	Connect your wallet
	2.	Tap Send gBase
	3.	Confirm the transaction on Base
	4.	Transaction is recorded
	5.	Stats update instantly
	6.	Share activity to Farcaster

Only one gBase transaction per hour is tracked inside the app.



# Features

Activity Page
	•	Large Send gBase button
	•	Total Base Transactions counter
	•	Countdown timer for next eligible hour

Stats Page
	•	Base Transactions
	•	Active Days
	•	Wallet Strength (New, Warming, Active, Strong, Very Strong)

Sharing

After every confirmed transaction, users can share their activity to Farcaster with captions like:

I just sent gBase on Base.
This wallet stays active.
I’ve sent 1,000 transactions so far on Base.



Design Principles
	•	Manual transactions only
	•	User pays gas
	•	No automation or background activity
	•	No streaks or multipliers
	•	One transaction per hour tracked
	•	Honest, verifiable metrics

gBase prioritizes credibility over gamification.
